# Disease-Symptom-Prediction

In this project, we developed three different models:

* Disease-Symptom Association: We built a system where users can input diseases and view all associated symptoms along with their support and confidence levels.
* Symptom-Symptom Association: Users can input a symptom and explore other symptoms that may co-occur, providing valuable insights into potential symptom patterns.
* Symptom Confidence Prediction: Input a symptom and discover the confidence level of it being a key indicator for a specific disease.
